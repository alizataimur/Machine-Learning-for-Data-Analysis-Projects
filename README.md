# Machine Learning for Data Analysis

This repository contains my lab work, assignments, datasets, and final project for the **Machine Learning for Data Analysis** course.  
It demonstrates a clear understanding of machine learning pipelines, model evaluation, and reproducible research practices.


## Skills Demonstrated

- Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
- Supervised Learning (Regression & Classification)
- Model Evaluation (MAE, RMSE, F1, ROC-AUC)
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Train/Test Pipeline Design
- Visual Analytics using Matplotlib & Seaborn

## Project list
The final project demonstrates the full ML pipeline:
1. Data preprocessing
2. Model selection & tuning
3. Model validation
4. Insight extraction
